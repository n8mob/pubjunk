How to Design Programs
==================================
The Basic Steps of a Design Recipe
----------------------------------

# 1. From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions
Identify the information that must be represented and how it is represented in the chosen programming language.
Formulate data definitions and illustrate them with examples.

# 2. Signature, Purpose Statement, Header
State what kind of data the desire function consumes and produces.
Formulate a concise answer to the question _what_ the function computes.
Define a stub that lives up to the signature.

# 3. Function Examples
Work through examples that illustrate the function's purpose.

# 4. Function Template
Translate the data definitions into an outline of the function.

# 5. Function Definition
Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the purpose statement and the examples.

# 6. Testing
Articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the function passes all.
Doing so discovers mistakes.
Tests also supplement examples in that they help others read and understand the definition when the need arises--and it will arise for any serious program.
